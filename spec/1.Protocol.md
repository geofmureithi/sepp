SEPP Protocol Specification
===========================

The SEPP (Standardized Exchangeable Payment Protocol) defines a structured and versatile communication framework between clients and servers for facilitating seamless payment interactions. This document outlines the communication layers and their respective components on both the client and server sides.

Communication Layers
--------------------

### Client Side

1.  **USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data):**
    
    *   USSD serves as the foundational layer, ensuring compatibility across a wide range of devices.
    *   Provides a text-based interactive session, enabling users to interact with the payment system via a simple interface.
    *   Suitable for basic devices that lack advanced capabilities.
2.  **Push Notification:**
    
    *   Offers a more dynamic and interactive communication channel between the client and server.
    *   Enables real-time updates, notifications, and responses to user-initiated actions.
    *   Enhances user experience and responsiveness on modern smartphones and devices.
3.  **OAuth 2.0 Client:**
    
    *   Represents the most sophisticated communication layer, designed for secure and authenticated interactions.
    *   Utilizes OAuth 2.0 protocol for authorization, ensuring data privacy and access control.
    *   Recommended for applications where security and user authentication are paramount.

### Server Side

1.  **SMS (Short Message Service):**
    
    *   Similar to USSD, SMS provides a fundamental layer of communication suitable for basic devices.
    *   Sends and receives text messages, allowing users to engage with the payment system even on feature phones.
2.  **Webhook:**
    
    *   Offers a robust mechanism for real-time communication from the server to the client.
    *   Sends HTTP callbacks to the client in response to specific events, facilitating immediate updates.
3.  **OAuth 2.0 Server:**
    
    *   The preferred method for secure server-to-server communication, especially for advanced applications.
    *   Implements OAuth 2.0 protocol to ensure proper authorization and data protection.
    *   Ideal for scenarios requiring secure API access and user data management.
    *   Supports server to server communication

Layer Hierarchy and Device Compatibility
----------------------------------------

The layers on both the client and server sides are organized in a hierarchy based on complexity and compatibility:

*   **Primitive Layers (USSD and SMS):** These layers ensure universal compatibility across a wide range of devices, including basic phones. They are designed to offer essential communication capabilities without relying on advanced technologies.
    
*   **Intermediate Layers (Push Notification and Webhook):** These layers cater to modern smartphones and devices. They provide dynamic and interactive communication, enhancing user experience through real-time updates and notifications.
    
*   **Advanced Layer (OAuth 2.0):** This layer emphasizes security, authentication, and controlled access to data. It is best suited for applications that demand stringent security measures and secure data handling.
    
----------

The SEPP protocol's well-defined communication layers provide flexibility to accommodate diverse devices and varying levels of sophistication. The layered approach ensures that payment interactions can take place seamlessly across a wide spectrum of devices, ranging from basic feature phones to advanced smartphones, while maintaining a high standard of security and user experience.
