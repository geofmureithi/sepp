SEPP Protocol Focus Areas
=========================

The SEPP (Standardized Exchangeable Payment Protocol) is designed with specific focus areas to ensure a robust, secure, and accessible payment ecosystem. These focus areas drive the development of the protocol, enabling various entities to transact seamlessly while upholding privacy and user experience.

1\. Security
------------

The SEPP protocol prioritizes security, providing a foundation for secure transactions. By implementing encryption, secure communication channels, and authentication mechanisms, SEPP ensures that entities can transact with confidence, safeguarding sensitive data from unauthorized access.

2\. Privacy
-----------

Privacy is a core principle of SEPP, enabling entities to transact without sharing sensitive information unnecessarily. Through encryption and anonymization techniques, the protocol ensures that transaction details are protected, contributing to a private and confidential payment experience.

3\. Accessibility
-----------------

SEPP aims to be accessible to users from all walks of life. The protocol's design takes into account diverse devices and user abilities, ensuring that payment interactions are intuitive and easy to navigate, regardless of the user's technical expertise or device capabilities.

4\. Consent
-----------

SEPP supports non-intrusive mobile payments, particularly in scenarios like recurring and cancelable payments. The protocol ensures that entities can initiate and process transactions with clear and informed consent from users, enhancing user control and minimizing unexpected transactions.

5\. Verification
----------------

Entities involved in transactions require verification mechanisms. SEPP enables entities to verify the authenticity of transactions, providing assurance that the transactions are legitimate and authorized. This verification feature enhances trust and reduces fraudulent activities.

6\. Reactivity
--------------

SEPP facilitates real-time updates and notifications to entities regarding activities in their accounts. This reactivity ensures that entities are promptly informed about changes, enhancing transparency and enabling timely responses to transaction-related events.

7\. Web Integration
-------------------

SEPP aligns with WebPayments, seamlessly integrating with web-based payment systems. This integration enhances interoperability between the SEPP protocol and existing web payment solutions, providing a consistent payment experience across different platforms.

The SEPP protocol's commitment to these focus areas aims to create a payment ecosystem that is secure, private, accessible, consent-driven, verifiable, reactive, and well-integrated with web-based solutions. By addressing these critical aspects, SEPP strives to provide a comprehensive and user-centric payment experience for entities across diverse contexts.
