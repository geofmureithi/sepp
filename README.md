Standardized Exchangeable Payment Protocol

## Problem Statement

The realm of payments is inherently complex. Having personally developed multiple payment systems in Kenya, I'm acutely aware of the challenges involved. It's not just about the technology; it's about enabling seamless transactions across borders and diverse financial landscapes. Consider the complexity of accepting payments from countries like Ghana, Namibia, or even our neighboring nation, Uganda.

The overarching aim of the Standardized Exchangeable Payment Protocol (SEPP) is to provide a comprehensive solution to this intricate challenge. While SEPP doesn't claim to be a universal remedy, it's a significant stride towards establishing common ground. By introducing standardized practices and protocols, SEPP aims to facilitate a smoother payment experience throughout Africa. It's about fostering consistency and cooperation in an inherently fragmented landscape.

## Concepts

### 1. Introduction

---

The Standardized Exchangeable Payment Protocol (SEPP) introduces a set of core concepts to streamline and standardize payment transactions across diverse financial landscapes. These concepts establish the foundational components that enable consistent and efficient payment processes, promoting interoperability and reliability.

### 2. Payment Request

---

A **Payment Request** is a pivotal entity within SEPP, representing a formal solicitation for initiating a monetary transaction. It encapsulates essential details necessary for payment initiation and seamless transmission across various systems.

#### 2.1. Attributes

- **Payer**: The entity initiating the payment request.
- **Payee**: The intended recipient of the payment.
- **Amount**: The monetary value associated with the payment request.
- **Currency**: The currency denomination for the payment.
- **Timestamp**: The timestamp indicating when the payment request was generated.
- **Reference**: An optional reference or note linked to the payment request.

### 3. Payee Destination

---

A **Payee Destination** designates the target endpoint where funds can be received as part of a payment transaction. It defines a specific address or account to which funds are destined.

#### 3.1. Attributes

- **Address**: The unique address or account identifier for the payee destination.
- **Type**: The categorization of the destination, encompassing bank accounts, cryptocurrency addresses, or other pertinent payment endpoints.

### 4. Recurring Payment

---

A **Recurring Payment** signifies a payment that recurs at predefined intervals. This concept streamlines periodic transactions, offering predictability and convenience.

#### 4.1. Attributes

- **Payment**: The payment details, analogous to those in a Payment Request.
- **Interval**: The time span between successive occurrences of the recurring payment.

### 5. Validation Request

---

A **Validation Request** serves as a mechanism for verifying the legitimacy and accuracy of a payment request. It empowers an external entity to validate the integrity of a transaction prior to execution.

### 5.1. Attributes

- **Initiator**: The entity initiating the validation request.
- **Validator**: The entity to which the validation request is directed.
- **Payment Request**: The payment request subject to validation.

## 6. Refund Request

---

A **Refund Request** facilitates the reversal of a completed transaction, enabling the return of funds from the payee to the payer. It establishes a structured approach for managing payment reversals.

### 6.1. Attributes

- **Initiator**: The entity initiating the refund request.
- **Transaction**: The transaction identifier or reference linked to the original payment.
- **Reason**: A description or code elucidating the rationale behind the refund request.

## Milestones

---

### Milestone 1: Specification

**Objective:** Lay the foundation by defining the purpose, scope, and fundamental requirements of the protocol.

1.  Clearly define the initiation, authorization, and processing processes of payments.
2.  Outline the essential data structures, message formats, and communication methods to be employed.

### Milestone 2: Design

**Objective:** Create a robust and adaptable protocol design that prioritizes security, scalability, and interoperability.

1.  Craft a protocol design that seamlessly integrates with existing payment systems.
2.  Incorporate scalability considerations to accommodate future growth and increased usage.
3.  Address security concerns by implementing encryption and authentication mechanisms.

### Milestone 3: Implementation

**Objective:** Transform the protocol design into tangible software components and codebase.

1.  Develop the core components of the protocol, ensuring adherence to the design.
2.  Create libraries and APIs that simplify integration for developers.
3.  Generate comprehensive documentation for developers to understand the implementation details.

### Milestone 4: Testing

**Objective:** Rigorously validate the protocol implementation to ensure robustness and reliability.

1.  Perform extensive testing to verify that the protocol functions as intended.
2.  Conduct vulnerability assessments to identify and mitigate potential weaknesses.
3.  Simulate real-world scenarios to validate performance and response times.

### Milestone 5: Validation

**Objective:** Gather external insights and expertise to refine and enhance the protocol.

1.  Collaborate with experts in payments and protocols to receive valuable feedback.
2.  Address feedback and make necessary adjustments to strengthen the protocol.
3.  Ensure that the protocol aligns with industry best practices and standards.

### Milestone 6: Documentation

**Objective:** Provide comprehensive documentation to guide developers in protocol implementation.

1.  Produce clear and comprehensive documentation detailing protocol usage.
2.  Include practical examples and integration guidelines for developers.
3.  Make the documentation readily accessible and user-friendly.

### Milestone 7: Promotion and Adoption

**Objective:** Foster widespread adoption of the protocol within the payments landscape.

1.  Promote the protocol's benefits and advantages to relevant industries and organizations.
2.  Collaborate with industry stakeholders to encourage adoption and integration.
3.  Foster a supportive community of developers and enthusiasts around the protocol.

By achieving these milestones, the SEPP initiative aims to revolutionize the payment landscape, creating a more seamless and standardized experience for transactions across Africa and beyond.
